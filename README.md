My name is Landon Turner and I am an athlete turned Software Engineer. I have a passion for development and bringing ideas to life. I started this journey in web development but I am eager and hungry to learn about mobile and gaming technologies as well. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full stack web development projects. A lot of time is being spent on building a rental site for my wonderful wife.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and JavaScript.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my budding software empire. The kid has a few ideas.
