My name is Landon Turner and I am an athlete turned Software Engineer. I have a passion for development and bringing ideas to life. I started this journey in web development but I am eager and hungry to learn about mobile and gaming technologies as well. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on API support and Internal tools for my employers, Teamworks. Unfortunately, we work with GitLab so that work will not be reflected here. I dabble on my side projects when I get a chance.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Flask, C++, Advanced React
