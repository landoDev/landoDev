**landoDev/landoDev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Landon Turner and I am an athlete turned Software Engineer. I have a passion for development and bringing ideas to life. I started this journey in web development but I am eager and hungry to learn about mobile and gaming technologies as well. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on full stack web development projects. A lot of time is being spent on building a rental site for my wonderful wife.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JavaScript.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my budding software empire. The kid has a few ideas.
